started Jan.22, 2019

## Purpose:
This is my first attempt at creating a working a basic MVC app using ASP.NET Core.

## Summary
This is to display a Time Magazine Person of the year and return results upon user input of years.

### How to run the program:
```
This program requires visual studio 2017.
Run the program to start the console application.
This will be under "Program.cs".
```

You may look at the source code to ensure nothing evil is in there.
```
* The web browser will welcome you to a Front Page of Time Magazine.
* The user then types in two numbers.  A starting year and end year.
* Upon clicking Submit, the webpage will redirect the user to a results page.
* The Results Page will display in a grid like pattern the people who were Time Magazine of those years.
* When finished viewing, simply exit the web brower.
```

This assignment took about 6 hours to complete.  There are no xUnit Testing for this assignment.

Below are screen shots of what this should look like.
